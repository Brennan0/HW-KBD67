# HW-KBD67
## Code written for this specifically handwired KBD67 Lite keyboard. This code is the complement to firmware code from KMK (https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/tree/master/kmk). 

This code was written for a handwired keyboard. The keyboard has the same layout as the KBD 67 Lite as the case for that specific keyboard was used for this project. 

## Controller
This keyboard used a Pi Pico but other controller boards should be usable. All you really need is enough pins on the board for a full keyboard matrix to be completed.

## How to use
1. handwire your keyboard and connect Pi Pico or other controller
2. figure out matrix mapping
3. download the kmk file from KMK keyboards
4. create code for keyboard mapping
